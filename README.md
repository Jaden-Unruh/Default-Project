# Default-Project
This is all the background code to set up a window and other things that all of my projects for Akana need.

It's pulled from my MaximoID project from the end of October 2023, but will not be updated as I finish that project. It's for my personal use in the future so I don't have to keep writing the same code over and over again - or for someone else at Akana if they are writing similar code.
